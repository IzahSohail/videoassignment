### Process 
- How did you go about implementing the concept

   ### Izah
  After collaboratively working on choosing a concept and story, my primary role was working on the website with Jiho. Given that the essence of our film revolves around a psychological experience, I aimed to ensure that the website's interface seamlessly complemented this theme. I worked a lot with JavaScript for this assignment to add more interactivity and create a more immersive experience. One of these interative features is the slider on the home page. The initial arrow (pill) position is strategically set as a percentage of the screen width. As users slide halfway across the slider, several dynamic changes occur:
  - The background color undergoes a smooth transition into a darker theme, symbolizing the initiation of the psychological journey. I considered changing the background back to the original one if the user slides back but decided not to as I feel this fits our concept better: once you reach a certain point, there is no returning
  - some text appears at the center of the screen offering users a brief insight into what lies ahead.
  - background music starts playing. I initially wanted the background music to play automatically however, after a lot of playing around with code and searching online, I realised autoplay isn't possible. So I decided to implement the audio feature this way and personally, I believe this approach contributes significantly better to the overall user experience!
  
  Sliding all the way to the end of the slider takes the user to the video experience page. Here I added a back to home button with some basic styling. At the end of each video, the user is given a choice between 2 options so I had to figure out how to implement that. Again, I had to work with a lot of javascript code to make this possible. I also added a typewriter text effect to text that is displayed at the end of each video for a better user experience.
